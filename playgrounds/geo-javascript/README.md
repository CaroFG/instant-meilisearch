# Javascript GeoSearch Playground

The provided Google Maps Api Key is limited at 300 requests per day, so it might be down sometimes. In which case, please create a new [Google Api Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and add it in the `.env` file at the root of the playground: `/playgrounds/geo-javascript`
